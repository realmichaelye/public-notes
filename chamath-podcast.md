Notes on Chamath's Podcast - How to Invest in this Crisis (Edited)
=========================================================

## Notes
- To allocate capital effectively over decades, you have to be exceptional at observing the current moment in time.

- One way to see how Covid-19 affects companies is to think: who are their customers, and how has Covid-19 affected these customers. Companies that are struggling will not make or stall decisions that aren't urgent. E.g. Workday's oil and gas customers likely won't be upgrading their enterprise software because of the drop in revenue.

- Point of Sales (PoS) software had a market cap of $15B, but has now gone to roughly zero sales for the time being.

- Companies have to build themselves from the ground up now. They won't have capital for all their must-haves, they won't be buying "nice-to-haves". Companies will be closely looking at what expenses they're willing to take on again - they'll spend cautiously. Many "mono-product" companies will be the first to get cut.

- US Movie thetres went from 200 mill revenue April 2 2020, to $5100 last week (before 2 Apr 2020)  

- Energy consumption has gone down a ton.

- Since 2015, many B2B startups focused their selling on SMBs (often other startups) becuase the money cycle was faster, and the quicker traction made it more enticing for VCs -> SMBs are more likely to stop buying due to Covid-19 (probably losing money) -> Many B2B startups are in trouble

- Create wedge -> expand.

- Global 1000 are more likely to stay on as customers to other companies. Their business will likely slow down, but probably not shut down.

  Before this, government is 1/3 GDP
  this year minimum 55-60% of GDP will likely be government sponsored.
  ^Result: we'll be dependent on the government

- Companies have optimized for efficiency, but at the cost of resiliance. E.g. overly reliant on foreign goods.

> Fulcrum asset -> "achilles heel" of a economy -> we rely on external sources like China

~26min: How to end Deflationary cycle
His solution: Refactor economy -> putting money in the system to create incentives to do things differently to cause prices to go up. Mandate things to be more domestically created. (this suggests a shift towards nationalism?)

- Trace-routing is key. Follow the money.

- What will happen with pensions? Will they get a government bailout? What are the second order effects of this?

**His solution: Choose the path of innefficiency -> innefficiency creates costs -> higher employment + higher wages**

- Bitcoin is still too speculative. The volatile US dollar won't be replaced with an even more volatile currency. It'll only go big if the US dollar is debased, instead of the US finding a way to "inflate their way out" -> Bitcoin becomes gold 2.0

- 37:50 to ~39:00 seems important, but I don't understand it.
^His solution: Choose the path of innefficiency -> innefficiency creates costs -> higher employment + higher wages

- Most emerging markets will probably fail. E.g. Argentina, Brazil etc. People will be looking to move their currency from these to USD.

- First thing to look at for making major profitable investments now: **"What is not going to change?"** -> what are our needs?

~52min: Describing how misconfigured wireless infastructure is

- Monitor alternative sources of data. Open Table, Yelp, Second Measure Credit Card Panels, Footfall data, TomTom --> What does this show in terms of patters?

- Chamath is also looking at commercial real-estate data. Are properties (e.g. Walmart locations) correctly valued?

- This form of data analysis is "excrutiatingly boring, numbing, time-consuming - but this how you'll find nuggets of insights"

- **The other part is "What things need to change?"** Chamath thinks that healthcare, education, and climate-change are the fasting changing industries due to this change to resiliancy caused by Covid-19, & looking to fund their J curve & buy the company. Looking to invest here.

- A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is formed to raise money through an IPO to buy another company --> allows public stock market investors to invest in private equity type transactions.

- Look for anti-correlation. What industries are up in this down market?

- Chamath wants to take social capital public in the future.

- During quarantine, a lot of people will be re-examining their values. Behavior in regards to travel, relationships, and priorities will change for many.

- It is likely that 90%+ of SMBs will shut-down over the next 3-years.

- There'll likely be a move towards nationalism in many countries - including nationalizing much of the supply chain. (Connects back with earlier note on how to end Deflationary cycle)

- He'd rather see the money go to the states & cities instead of private companies (those should wiped out).

- He believes share buybacks should be punished, instead comapnies should reinvest into serving humanity -> [Vox made a good video about this](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/2/17639762/stock-buybacks-tax-cuts-trump-republicans) 

## Example Sectors that have stopped "buying" due to Covid-19
- Oil and gas
- Airlines
- Hospitality
- Bankind
- Theatres
- Public transport

## Questions
- What does it mean for a company to be "10x their market cap"?
- What are the consequences if the US just keeps printing money?
- What are common operational expenses (OpEx) for companies?
- Chamath says most likely path for the US is to force companies to do everything domestically --> higher employment and prices. Why exactly is this?
- Chamath says the US needs to "inflate their way out" of this crisis. What is meant by this and why? ***(A: I think he meant inflate their way out = creating inefficiencies to drive up prices -> results in more business opportunities -> more jobs + higher wages)***

## Next Steps
- Learn about equities, treasuries, bonds etc. Is there a go to resource for this? Is this all convered in an introductory economics course / textbook?
- Learn about debt and currency markets.
